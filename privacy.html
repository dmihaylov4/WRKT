    <p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Workout tracking data is stored locally on your device</li>

    <h2>Social Features and Data Sharing</h2>

    <h3>What's Stored in the Cloud</h3>

        <li><strong>Battles & Challenges:</strong> Competition participation, scores, leaderboards</li>
        <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> Real-time activity notifications</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What Remains Local Only</h3>

        <li>Rest timer settings</li>
        <li>App preferences (units, haptics, etc.)</li>
    </ul>

        <li>Create an account but keep your profile private</li>
        <li>Control who sees each workout post (public/friends/private)</li>
        <li>Delete your social account and all cloud data at any time</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>1. Workout Data</h3>
    <p>When you use VOLIA to track your workouts, we store the following information <strong>locally on your device</strong>:</p>
    <ul>

    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To track your fitness progress and provide personalized workout recommendations.</p>

    <h3>2. HealthKit Data</h3>

        <li>Workout history</li>
        <li>Heart rate data during workouts</li>
        <li>Exercise time and calories burned</li>

    </ul>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To provide comprehensive workout insights, sync workout data across your health apps, and display workout routes on maps.</p>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> We only read this data to display it within the app. We save strength training workouts back to HealthKit so your fitness data stays synchronized across your devices.</p>

    <h3>3. Personal Information</h3>

    </ul>

    <p>If you grant location permission, we use your location data <strong>only</strong> to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Display interactive route maps for cardio workouts synced from HealthKit</li>
        <li>Show where you ran, cycled, or walked</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> Location data is only used when the app is in use and only for displaying routes. We do not track your location in the background or share it with anyone.</p>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information collected to:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Track your workout progress</strong> - Store and display your exercise history</li>
        <li><strong>Calculate statistics</strong> - Compute PRs, volume, training frequency, and muscle group balance</li>
        <li><strong>Provide recommendations</strong> - Suggest appropriate weights based on your history</li>
        <li><strong>Gamification</strong> - Award XP, levels, achievements, and rewards for motivation</li>
        <li><strong>Sync with Health</strong> - Save strength training workouts to Apple Health</li>
        <li><strong>Display routes</strong> - Show maps of your cardio activities from HealthKit</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>

    <h3>Hybrid Storage Model</h3>
    <p>VOLIA uses a hybrid approach to data storage:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Workout tracking data is stored on your device</li>
        <li><strong>Cloud Storage:</strong> Social features use Supabase (EU region) for data sync and sharing</li>
        <li><strong>Your Choice:</strong> Social features are optional - use offline mode for local-only storage</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Cloud Storage Security (Supabase)</h3>
    <p>When you use social features, your data is protected by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>End-to-end encryption</strong> - All data transmitted via HTTPS/TLS</li>
        <li><strong>EU data residency</strong> - Supabase servers located in European Union</li>
        <li><strong>Row-Level Security (RLS)</strong> - Database-level privacy enforcement</li>
        <li><strong>Authentication</strong> - Secure email/password authentication</li>
        <li><strong>Access controls</strong> - You control who sees your data (public/friends/private)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Local Data Protection</h3>
    <p>Data stored on your device is protected using:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>File encryption</strong> - Data is encrypted when your device is locked (NSFileProtectionComplete)</li>
        <li><strong>iOS security</strong> - Leverages Apple's built-in device encryption</li>
        <li><strong>HealthKit privacy</strong> - All HealthKit access follows Apple's strict privacy guidelines</li>
        <li><strong>Sandboxed storage</strong> - App data isolated from other apps</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Backups</h3>
    <p><strong>Local data:</strong> Automatically backed up as part of your device's encrypted backup (iTunes/iCloud backup). These backups are controlled by Apple's backup policies and are encrypted.</p>
    <p><strong>Cloud data:</strong> Social feature data is stored on Supabase servers with automatic backups. You can export or delete this data at any time through the app.</p>
