# Storage System Migration Guide

## Overview

The workout storage system has been completely refactored to provide a unified, robust, and efficient storage solution. This replaces the previous dual-storage system that wrote to both Application Support and Documents directories.

## What Changed

### Before (Old System)
- **Dual Storage**: Every save wrote to BOTH locations
  - Application Support: `WRKT/completed_workouts.json`, `pr_index.json`, etc.
  - Documents: `workouts.json`, `runs.json`, etc.
- **Complex Migration Logic**: Init method had ~60 lines of merge logic
- **No Error Handling**: Silent failures, no recovery strategies
- **Scattered PR Management**: Separate file, separate load/save logic
- **No Backups**: No automatic backup system
- **No Validation**: No data integrity checks

### After (New System)
- **Single Source of Truth**: Documents/WRKT_Storage directory
- **Unified Storage**: One file contains workouts + PR index atomically
- **Proper Error Handling**: Custom error types, detailed messages
- **Automatic Backups**: Last 5 backups retained automatically
- **Data Validation**: Metadata tracking and integrity checks
- **Thread-Safe**: Actor-based storage for safe concurrent access
- **Enhanced PR Tracking**: New fields (allTimeBest, firstRecorded)

## New Architecture

### Storage Structure
```
Documents/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ WRKT_Storage/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ workouts_v2.json          # Workouts + PR index (atomic)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ current_workout_v2.json   # Current in-progress workout
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ runs_v2.json              # Cardio/HealthKit data
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .migrated                 # Migration flag
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Backups/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ workouts_backup_2025-10-22T10-30-00.json
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ workouts_backup_2025-10-22T09-15-00.json
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (last 5 backups)
```

### Key Components

#### 1. WorkoutStorage Actor
- **Thread-safe**: All operations through actor isolation
- **Atomic operations**: Workouts and PR index saved together
- **Error handling**: Throws detailed errors for debugging
- **Backup system**: Automatic backups before writes
- **Migration**: One-time migration from legacy storage

#### 2. Enhanced Data Models
- **StorageMetadata**: Version, lastModified, itemCount
- **WorkoutStorageContainer**: Workouts + PR index + metadata
- **ExercisePRsV2**: Enhanced PR tracking with new fields
  - `bestPerReps`: Best weight for each rep count
  - `bestE1RM`: Best estimated 1-rep max
  - `lastWorking`: Most recent working set
  - `allTimeBest`: Best weight ever lifted (NEW)
  - `firstRecorded`: First time exercise was performed (NEW)

#### 3. WorkoutStoreV2
- Clean separation of concerns
- No disk I/O logic (delegated to WorkoutStorage)
- Simplified initialization
- All business logic preserved
- Stats integration maintained

## Migration Process

### Automatic Migration
The system performs automatic migration on first launch:

1. **Detection**: Checks for `.migrated` flag
2. **Data Collection**: Loads from ALL old locations:
   - Application Support/WRKT/
   - Documents/ (old Persistence location)
3. **Deduplication**: Merges by UUID, keeps newest
4. **PR Index**: Converts old format or recomputes from workouts
5. **Save**: Writes to new unified storage
6. **Flag**: Marks migration complete
7. **Preserve**: Old files kept for safety

### Migration Output
```
üîÑ Starting migration from legacy storage...
   üì¶ Found 150 workouts in legacy Application Support
   üì¶ Found 25 PR entries in legacy storage
   üì¶ Found 45 runs in legacy storage
   üì¶ Found current workout in legacy storage
   üì¶ Found 148 workouts in old Persistence location
‚úÖ Migration complete:
   Workouts: 150 (deduplicated)
   Runs: 45
   PR entries: 25
   Current workout: Yes
‚ö†Ô∏è Old storage files retained for safety
```

## How to Switch to New System

### Step 1: Add Files to Xcode Project
1. Add `WorkoutStorage.swift` to Persistence folder
2. Add `WorkoutStoreV2.swift` to WorkoutStore folder
3. Build to ensure no compilation errors

### Step 2: Update Dependencies
Replace all instances where WorkoutStore is created:

**Before:**
```swift
@StateObject private var workoutStore = WorkoutStore()
```

**After:**
```swift
@StateObject private var workoutStore = WorkoutStoreV2()
```

### Step 3: Update Type References
If you have explicit type annotations, update them:

**Before:**
```swift
let store: WorkoutStore
```

**After:**
```swift
let store: WorkoutStoreV2
```

### Step 4: Test Migration
1. **With Existing Data**: Launch app with existing data
   - Check console for migration messages
   - Verify all workouts loaded
   - Check PR suggestions still work
2. **Fresh Install**: Test on simulator/device without data
   - Should initialize cleanly
   - Create test workout
   - Verify persistence

### Step 5: Verify Data
Run validation to ensure data integrity:
```swift
Task {
    let isValid = try await WorkoutStorage.shared.validateStorage()
    print("Storage valid: \(isValid)")

    let stats = await WorkoutStorage.shared.getStorageStats()
    print("Stats: \(stats)")
}
```

### Step 6: Clean Up (Optional)
After verifying data is correct, clean up old files:
```swift
Task {
    try await WorkoutStorage.shared.cleanupLegacyStorage()
    print("‚úÖ Legacy files removed")
}
```

## API Compatibility

### Maintained APIs (No Changes Required)
All public APIs of WorkoutStore are preserved in WorkoutStoreV2:

- `currentWorkout`, `completedWorkouts`, `runs` - @Published properties
- `startWorkoutIfNeeded()`, `finishCurrentWorkout()` - Workout lifecycle
- `addExerciseToCurrent()`, `updateEntrySets()` - Entry management
- `addWorkout()`, `updateWorkout()`, `deleteWorkouts()` - CRUD operations
- `addRun()`, `updateRun()`, `importRunsFromHealth()` - Run management
- `lastWorkingSet()`, `suggestedWorkingWeight()` - Weight suggestions
- `matchWithHealthKit()` - HealthKit integration

### Changed Internal Implementation
These are now handled by WorkoutStorage (transparent to callers):
- Persistence operations (async + error handling)
- PR index management (now atomic with workouts)
- Backup creation (automatic)
- Migration (one-time automatic)

## Benefits

### 1. Performance
- **50% fewer disk writes**: Single location instead of dual writes
- **Atomic operations**: No risk of partial writes
- **Background persistence**: Non-blocking saves

### 2. Reliability
- **Error handling**: Proper error types and recovery
- **Data validation**: Integrity checks on load
- **Automatic backups**: Last 5 backups always available
- **Transaction safety**: All-or-nothing writes

### 3. Maintainability
- **Single source of truth**: No merge logic needed
- **Clean separation**: Storage vs business logic
- **Type safety**: Strong typing for all storage operations
- **Testability**: Actor isolation makes testing easier

### 4. Features
- **Enhanced PR tracking**: New metrics (allTimeBest, firstRecorded)
- **Storage stats**: Query storage size, counts, dates
- **Backup management**: List and restore from backups
- **Storage validation**: Verify data integrity

## Error Handling

### Storage Errors
```swift
enum StorageError: LocalizedError {
    case fileNotFound(String)
    case encodingFailed(String, underlying: Error)
    case decodingFailed(String, underlying: Error)
    case writeFailed(String, underlying: Error)
    case migrationFailed(String)
    case validationFailed(String)
    case backupFailed(String)
}
```

### Handling Errors
```swift
Task {
    do {
        let (workouts, prIndex) = try await storage.loadWorkouts()
        // Use data
    } catch StorageError.decodingFailed(let type, let error) {
        print("Failed to decode \(type): \(error)")
        // Handle gracefully
    } catch {
        print("Storage error: \(error)")
    }
}
```

## Backup & Recovery

### Automatic Backups
- Created before every write operation
- Last 5 backups retained (configurable)
- Named with ISO8601 timestamp
- Stored in `WRKT_Storage/Backups/`

### Manual Backup Management
```swift
// List available backups
let backups = try await WorkoutStorage.shared.listBackups()
for backup in backups {
    print("Backup: \(backup.lastPathComponent)")
}

// Restore from backup
try await WorkoutStorage.shared.restoreFromBackup(at: backupURL)
```

## Statistics Integration

The new storage system maintains full integration with StatsAggregator:

- Workout completion triggers stats update
- Edit/delete operations invalidate affected weeks
- All existing statistics functionality preserved
- No changes needed to StatsAggregator code

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Migration runs successfully with existing data
- [ ] All workouts visible after migration
- [ ] PR suggestions work correctly
- [ ] Weight suggestions accurate
- [ ] Current workout persists across app restarts
- [ ] Workout completion saves correctly
- [ ] Runs sync from HealthKit
- [ ] Statistics display correctly
- [ ] Calendar view shows workouts
- [ ] Fresh install works (no migration)
- [ ] Storage validation passes
- [ ] Backups created on writes
- [ ] Old files can be cleaned up safely

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, you can rollback:

1. **Revert code changes**: Switch back to old WorkoutStore
2. **Data is safe**: Old files preserved during migration
3. **Re-migrate if needed**: Delete `.migrated` flag to re-run

## Advanced Features

### Storage Stats
```swift
let stats = await WorkoutStorage.shared.getStorageStats()
print("Workouts: \(stats["workoutCount"])")
print("File size: \(stats["workoutsFileSize"])")
print("Oldest: \(stats["oldestWorkout"])")
```

### Validation
```swift
let isValid = try await WorkoutStorage.shared.validateStorage()
if !isValid {
    // Handle invalid data
}
```

### Development: Wipe All Data
```swift
#if DEBUG
try await WorkoutStorage.shared.wipeAllData()
#endif
```

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Console**: Look for migration and storage log messages
2. **Validate Storage**: Run `validateStorage()` to check integrity
3. **Check Backups**: List backups to verify they exist
4. **Review Errors**: Storage errors include detailed context

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Add files to Xcode project
2. ‚úÖ Update WorkoutStore references to WorkoutStoreV2
3. ‚úÖ Test migration with existing data
4. ‚úÖ Verify all features work
5. ‚úÖ Run validation

7. üóëÔ∏è Remove old WorkoutStore.swift (optional, keep for reference)

## Summary

This migration provides a modern, robust storage system that:
- Eliminates complexity (dual writes, merge logic)
- Improves reliability (error handling, backups, validation)
- Enhances performance (single write path, atomic operations)
- Maintains compatibility (same public API)
- Adds new features (enhanced PR tracking, backup management)

The migration is automatic and safe, with old data preserved as a fallback.
