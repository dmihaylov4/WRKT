## 📱 Selecting Your Best 10 Screenshots

Apple allows up to 10 screenshots. Here's how to choose the best ones:

### **Screenshot Order Best Practices**

The first 3 screenshots are the MOST important - they appear in search results and are seen first.

### **Recommended Screenshot Strategy:**

#### **Screenshots 1-3: Hero Shots (Core Value Props)**
These should immediately show what makes your app special:

1. **Social Feed** - Show workout posts from friends (demonstrates social/competitive aspect)
2. **Active Battle** - Show head-to-head competition with live scores (key differentiator)
3. **Workout Session** - Show the core workout tracking experience

#### **Screenshots 4-7: Feature Showcase**
Show breadth of features:

4. **Compete Hub** - Show battles/challenges overview
5. **Friends Activity** - Show friend connections and activity
6. **Progress/Stats** - Show personal records, achievements, or muscle balance
7. **Weekly Goals** - Show streak tracking and weekly progress

#### **Screenshots 8-10: Supporting Features**
Round out the experience:

8. **HealthKit Integration** - Show cardio tracking or route maps
9. **Exercise Browser** - Show the exercise library or body browse view
10. **Profile** - Show level system, achievements, or milestones

## 🎯 What Makes a Good Screenshot

### ✅ Include:
- **Clear UI** - Interface is visible and readable
- **Real data** - Shows actual functionality (even if mock)
- **Social proof** - Posts, friends, battles show others using the app
- **Progression** - Show that users can track growth over time
- **Engagement** - Likes, comments, battle scores show active community

### ❌ Avoid:
- **Empty states** - "No data yet" screens
- **Settings screens** - Not exciting for first-time viewers
- **Duplicate concepts** - Don't show two battle screenshots
- **Too much text** - Let the UI speak for itself
