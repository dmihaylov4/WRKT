## 📞 Questions?

**"Should I include 'free'?"**
No. Apple doesn't rank apps based on price, and it wastes characters.

**"Should I include competitor names?"**
No. It's against Apple's guidelines and won't help you rank.

**"How often should I update keywords?"**
Every 2-3 months, or when you add major features.

**"Can I see which keywords are working?"**
Yes, in App Store Connect → Analytics → Sources → App Store Search

**"Should I use the same keywords in my app description?"**
No. Keywords are separate. Use natural language in your description.
