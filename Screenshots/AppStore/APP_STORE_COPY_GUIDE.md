## 🔒 Privacy Policy - CRITICAL

**Status:** ⚠️ **YOU MUST UPDATE YOUR PRIVACY POLICY**

Since you now collect user data (accounts, social interactions, posts, etc.), you **must** have a compliant privacy policy.

### **What Your Privacy Policy Must Cover:**

1. **Account Information:**
   - Email, username, display name
   - How it's used (account creation, authentication)
   - How it's stored (Supabase cloud database)

2. **User-Generated Content:**
   - Workout posts, comments, photos
   - Who can see this data (friends, public, private)
   - How long it's retained

3. **Social Features:**
   - Friend connections
   - Battle/challenge participation
   - Activity feeds

4. **HealthKit Data:**
   - What health data is accessed
   - How it's used (display in app, sync workouts)
   - **IMPORTANT:** Explicitly state you don't share HealthKit data with third parties
   - How it's stored (locally on device, not uploaded to servers)

5. **Analytics & Tracking:**
   - What analytics you collect (if any)
   - Third-party services used (Firebase, etc.)

6. **Data Deletion:**
   - How users can delete their data
   - What happens when account is deleted

7. **Contact Information:**
   - Your email for privacy inquiries

### **Quick Solution:**

Use a privacy policy generator:
- **Termly** (https://termly.io/) - Free tier available

Or hire a lawyer for a custom policy (recommended if you plan to scale).

## 🎯 App Store Keywords

**Current Recommendation:**
```
fitness,workout,gym,training,social,challenge,battle,weightlifting,bodybuilding,strength,exercise,tracking,friends,compete,accountability
```

**Character Limit:** 100 characters (including commas)

**Tips:**
- Don't include spaces after commas
- Don't repeat words from app name/subtitle
- Focus on how users search ("workout tracker", "gym app", etc.)
- Separate words don't need to be together ("social fitness" = "social" + "fitness")

---

## 📊 Age Rating

**Recommendation:** **4+** (No Objectionable Content)

**UNLESS** you allow user-generated content to be fully public, in which case you might need **12+** or **17+** for:
- Social networking features
- User-generated content that's not actively moderated

**Your Case:** Since posts can be Private/Friends-only, and you have reporting mechanisms, **12+** is safest.

---

## 🌍 Localization (Future)

Currently, all copy is in **English (U.S.)**

If you plan to expand internationally, consider translating:
- App description
- What's New
- Screenshots (with text overlays)
- Keywords

**Priority Markets:**
1. English (UK, Canada, Australia)
2. Spanish
3. German
4. French
5. Portuguese (Brazil)

---

## 🚀 Post-Launch Strategy

### **Week 1-2:**
