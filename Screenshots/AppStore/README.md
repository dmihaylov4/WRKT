## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Privacy Policy Required

**YOU MUST CREATE A PRIVACY POLICY BEFORE SUBMITTING**

Since your app now has social features (user accounts, posts, friend connections), Apple requires a privacy policy.

**Options:**
1. Use a generator (Termly, PrivacyPolicies.com)
2. Hire a lawyer (recommended if scaling)

See `APP_STORE_COPY_GUIDE.md` section "Privacy Policy" for details.

## 📱 Device Size Reference

Your screenshots are formatted for:
- **iPhone 14 Pro Max (6.7")** - Primary
- Also compatible with: iPhone 15 Pro Max, iPhone 13 Pro Max, iPhone 12 Pro Max

**Note:** You may want to create additional screenshot sets for:
- 6.5" display (iPhone 11 Pro Max, XS Max)
- 5.5" display (iPhone 8 Plus, older devices)

Apple will scale your 6.7" screenshots for other sizes, but dedicated sets look better.

## 📊 App Store Optimization (ASO) Tips

### **First Impressions Matter**
The first 3 screenshots are visible without scrolling:
1. Social Feed - Shows unique social/competitive features
2. Compete Hub - Shows battles and challenges
3. Home Progress - Shows goal tracking

These were strategically chosen to grab attention immediately.

### **Keywords to Focus On**
Based on your app's features:
- "social fitness tracker"
- "workout challenges"
- "fitness battles"
- "compete with friends"
- "accountability app"

### **Monitor & Iterate**
After launch:
- Track conversion rate (views → downloads)
- Read user reviews for messaging insights
- A/B test screenshots (future updates)
- Refine description based on what resonates

---

## 🎯 What Changed From v1.0

### **Old App (v1.0):**
- Solo workout tracker
- Offline-first
- Privacy-focused
- No account required

### **New App (v2.0):**
- **Social fitness platform**
- **Competitive features (battles, challenges)**
- **Friend connections**
- **Workout sharing**
- Cloud-enabled for social features
- Still free, but now requires account

**Marketing Shift:** From "private tracking tool" → "social accountability platform"
