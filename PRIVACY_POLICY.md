## Information We Collect

### 1. Workout Data
When you use WRKT to track your workouts, we store the following information **locally on your device**:

- Exercise time and calories burned
- Cardio workout routes (running, cycling, walking)

**Purpose:** To provide comprehensive workout insights, sync workout data across your health apps, and display workout routes on maps.

**Important:** We only read this data to display it within the app. We save strength training workouts back to HealthKit so your fitness data stays synchronized across your devices.

### 3. Personal Information

- Display interactive route maps for cardio workouts synced from HealthKit
- Show where you ran, cycled, or walked

**Important:** Location data is only used when the app is in use and only for displaying routes. We do not track your location in the background or share it with anyone.
